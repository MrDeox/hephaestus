# Active Context - Current Memory

## Current Status (2025-07-13)

**What we're doing right now:** Implementing Ultimate Guide best practices for project organization and memory management.

**Last completed:** Successfully implemented autonomous revenue generation system that identifies market opportunities and creates projects using RSI capabilities.

## Current Active Systems

- ✅ **RSI Orchestrator**: Main system operational on port 8000
- ✅ **Autonomous Revenue Generator**: Discovering opportunities and managing projects
- ✅ **Gap Scanner**: Detecting performance/functionality gaps (latest: high latency, missing metrics)
- ✅ **Hypothesis System**: Generating and validating improvement strategies
- ✅ **Safety Systems**: Multi-layer protection and validation
- ✅ **Memory Systems**: Episodic, semantic, procedural, working memory

## Recent Discoveries

1. **Performance Gap**: P99 latency ~2.2s (threshold: 1s) - revenue opportunity for optimization services
2. **Metrics Gap**: 63% coverage - opportunity for monitoring solutions  
3. **Feature Gap**: Missing behavior patterns - opportunity for feature enhancement

## Active Revenue Projects

- 3 active projects generated from gap analysis
- Revenue opportunities identified: $60K-$91K potential
- System using RSI for continuous improvement

## Next Priority Actions

1. Monitor autonomous revenue generation progress
2. Optimize performance gaps identified by scanner
3. Enhance metrics coverage for better observability
4. Continue RSI hypothesis testing and deployment
