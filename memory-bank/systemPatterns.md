# System Patterns & Architecture

## Core Architecture

**Eight-Layer RSI Architecture:**
1. **Core System** (`src/core/`) - State management, model versioning
2. **Learning System** (`src/learning/`) - Online learning, meta-learning, RL
3. **Validation System** (`src/validation/`) - Comprehensive input/output validation
4. **Safety System** (`src/safety/`) - Circuit breakers, failure prevention
5. **Security System** (`src/security/`) - Multi-layer sandboxing
6. **Monitoring System** (`src/monitoring/`) - Telemetry, anomaly detection, audit
7. **Hypothesis System** (`src/hypothesis/`) - RSI hypothesis generation and testing
8. **Revenue System** (`src/objectives/`) - Autonomous revenue generation

## Key Design Patterns

### Safety-First Pattern
```
Input → Validation → Circuit Breaker → Execution → Monitoring → Audit
```

### Immutable State Pattern
- All state changes through pyrsistent structures
- Atomic transitions with rollback capability
- Structural sharing for performance

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic failure detection and recovery
- Distributed state management with Redis
- Configurable thresholds and timeouts

### Online Learning Pipeline
```
Features → Validation → Prediction → Learning → State Update → Drift Detection
```

### Multi-Layer Security
- RestrictedPython (AST-based code analysis)
- Subprocess isolation (resource limits)
- Docker containers (when available)
- Fallback mechanisms ensure execution

### RSI Hypothesis Cycle
1. Gap Detection (analyze performance metrics)
2. Hypothesis Generation (Optuna + Ray optimization)
3. Safety Validation (multi-layer verification)
4. Secure Execution (sandboxed testing)
5. Statistical Validation (significance testing)
6. Human Review (approval workflows)
7. Deployment (automated integration)
8. Monitoring (continuous feedback)

## Error Handling Philosophy

- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation even when advanced features fail
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers prevent corruption
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Conservative settings when components are unavailable
- **Comprehensive Audit**: All operations logged with cryptographic integrity
